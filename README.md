# contact
Hello,
I'm attempting to contact you because you've worked on several Save Decryptors for ATLUS games.
I'm currently trying to get PS4 saves for Persona 5 Royal working on the Switch version of the game but I'm having issues.
I have decrypted PS4 saves for P5R that have a .dat file extension and the Switch version also saves in .dat files.
Unforunately, it doesn't seem as though they are directly transferable.
The PS4 saves are 256kb whereas the Switch saves are only 5kb.
The PS4 saves are end game saves however so I don't know if that makes a difference but I doubt it does.
I've used your SMT 3 Nocturne Save Decryption tool to decrypt my Steam save and transfer it to Switch and although this is an entirely different situation, I'd like to ask if you have any possible insights on how I could get a PS4 save working on Switch.
Ultimately I would  like to get PS4 saves working on PC but the PC version is unavailable at this current moment.
I would greatly appreciate any assistance you could provide and you can contact me via email or Discord.
